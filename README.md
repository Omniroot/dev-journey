# dev-journey
A developer's journey to mastering the software craft

*Note* - this repo is designed for me to collect my personal thoughts, reading list, etc. as part of my journey honing my craft as a software developer. It was not written to be consumed by the public, although I have left the repository as `public` in case others find something in here helpful to them.
